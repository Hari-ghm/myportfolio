          Hello! Iâ€™m an engineering student with a strong focus on applied
          physics and a passion for solving real-world problems through
          innovation and technology. Over my academic journey, I've tackled
          complex subjects like magnetic circuits, analyzing factors like
          reluctance, mmf, and magnetic flux to gain a deeper understanding of
          how physics shapes our world
